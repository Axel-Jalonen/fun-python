# Using the syntactic sugar for "emulating callable objects"
# by defining `__call__` on a class. This only works via an
# *instance*, since the first `()` on a class *always*
# constructs an instanceâ€”it does not invoke `__call__`.
Main()("Hello, World")	# Prints "Hello, World"

# No instantiation occurs here. We bypass the instance entirely
# by invoking the unbound method directly and supplying a dummy
# `self`. This only works because `self` is unused.
Main.__call__("", "Hello, World") # Prints "Hello, World"
Main.entry("Hello, World") # Prints "Hello, World"

# Prints address of the bound method suitable to be passed
# as a first class function
print(Main().__call__)	

# We can pass bounded or unbound methods to methods
# who themselves are either bound or unbound
# note the bound method implicitly performs a curry-like
# operation with `self`, the parent class instance
# Bound method:
Main()("Hello, World", [Main().side_effect, Main.side_effect])
# Unbound method:
Main.__call__("", "Hello, World", [Main().side_effect, Main.side_effect])
# Unbound method, taking the unbound method `__call__`
# internally calling itself with "Hello, World" 
Main.__call__("", "Hello, World", [Main.__call__])
